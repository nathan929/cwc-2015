# CWC 2015: Accelerated Front-End Development with Node.js and Gulp

Node.js is quickly taking hold in development shops that traditionally use Ruby, Python, or shell scripts to compile, lint, and distribute front-end assets for their applications. Why? Mainly because it's fast. But it's also easy to configure and share across teams.

Included in this repository are several examples, some using Gulp to build front-end assets, and a few others demonstrating the basic concepts of Node streams.

In the conference workshop, I went over the basic example. However, the more advanced (Angular) example is your homework. It's essentially a fork of my [gulp-app-skeleton](http://github.com/originalmachine/gulp-app-skeleton), which encapsulates best practices for developing Angular apps on the MEAN stack.
